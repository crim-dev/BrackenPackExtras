# Bracken Pack Extras

[![](https://dcbadge.vercel.app/api/server/AtuqxsXfDM)](https://discord.gg/AtuqxsXfDM)

ORIGINAL PACK (PLANET MINECRAFT DOWNLOAD) : [LINK](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/the-bracken-pack/)

## Presentation

This is a version of the Bracken Datapack that aims at introducing community suggestions as well as other, unofficial projects for the sake of testing, archiving and openness with the community's members who are interested in contributing.

Currently on version _v105_ of the Datapack

This is NOT the real Github repository for the Bracken Pack.

## Features 
Currently introduced : 

- Hovering text to BSB (jakerson_) [made it into official pack!]

- Custom armor trims for each dimension (by PaleFlesh) [made it into official pack!]

Planned (sorted by order of priority/urgence) :

- Brine Portal explorer map (RaspyHarmony101)
This one already had an implementation, I just need to make sure that it's adapted to v105 and we're basically good to go

- Water resistance for aquasensitive races (no definite suggestor)
Self-explanatory. 

- RPG-style titles (j8ck)

- Crystal Caves explorer map / locater (SixLuckyBlocks)
SLB with the clutch suggestions

- Custom Enchantments Beta (dev team)
This one's gonna take a long while to implement, but it'll go into the official pack once it's done.

- Brine fishing loot (pea_sh0ter#4650)
This one isn't feasible without breaking compatibility with other datapacks, however it is veryyyy much interesting to me.

- Resistance 5 instead of Weakness 10 in Pax (clanyfonelyx)


Noticed : 

- Vitality helmet (SixLuckyBlocks)
Cool and all but I don't plan to put this in the Extras yet

- Species tweaks (jakerson_)
Arbritrium :shush:

- Replace the tinted glass bubble during void travel (clanyfonelyx)
I had plans to make a custom box that wouldn't break important stuff (like the End portal, or chests) but it got rebuked by the rest of the dev team, I'm gonna bring this back here eventually.

- Secret achievement for visiting all dimensions (clanyfonelyx)
Might wanna make a 100% achievement instead

- Vine lash spell book (crimdev)
Not important to do atm

- Willful rift spell book (crimdev)
I really wanna do this eventually but other features take precedence

- Cross-dimensional structure (no definite suggestor)
Interesting but idk how to do that one appropriately either, plus I'd need to build something and I'm not a good builder by any means. Also, coordinate scaling may interfere with this

- Mixing species (Casper2137) 
Enormously complicated. I love it.

Discarded : 

- Sculk species (Player)
Just no. We already have enough on our hands from battling the Void, we don't need another anomaly, thank you.

- Make dwellers consume ore rather than food (The_Crocs_Man)

- More advancements (SixLuckyBlocks)
Implemented through v105

- Brine geysers (pea_sh0ter#4650)
Idk how to implement this one sorry
